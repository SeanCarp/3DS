There are 3 main ways that files are ran on the 3DS.
  a.**CIA** are easy as they can be put in new folder called `CIAS` on root of the SD card. Once booted, the games will appear in menu.
  b.**3DSX** are medium as they need to put into the `3ds` folder and then opened up through the Homebrew Launcer.
  c.**3ds** can be installed using the GodMode9 menu ("Start" and Power on at the same time). Then `GAMECART -> (A) [Title.3ds] -> NCSD image options -> Decrypt file ():/gm9/out)`
